//! Module to asynchronously provide a file locking mechanism using advisory
//! locks. The concept for this has largely been borrowed from `fd-lock` crate,
//! but simplified in the following ways:
//!
//! - Only non-Solaris unix is supported.
//! - Asynchronous interface to obtain the lock (using a task)
//! - Lock simply provides a semaphore-like mechanism - no read/write access is
//!   provided to the lockfile.
//!
//! # My understanding of advisory lock behaviour
//! Advisory locks are managed by the kernel and are automatically dropped by
//! the kernel when the process holding them is killed. This means we shouldn't
//! have the risk of a process crashing and not releasing the lock.
//!
//! # Note from fd-lock
//! “advisory locks” are locks which programs must opt-in to adhere to. This
//! means that they can be used to coordinate file access, but not prevent
//! access. Use this to coordinate file access between multiple instances of the
//! same program. But do not use this to prevent actors from accessing or
//! modifying files.
